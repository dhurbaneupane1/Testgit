## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df<-read.csv("us.csv",header = T)
head(df)
tail(df)
dim(df)
plot(1:489,df$cases,col="darkgreen", cex=0.5,xlab = "Days",ylab="Num.cases", main = "Covid-19 Cases in the United States")
png("Covid_cases.png",width= 10, height= 10,res=600)

dev.off()

```
